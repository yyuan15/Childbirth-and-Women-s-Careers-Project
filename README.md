# Childbirth-and-Women-s-Careers-Project
All the data for this project comes from IPUMS CPS
This independent project seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of childbirth on women's working careers. By examining a variety of variables, I aim to gain a nuanced understanding of the challenges facing women in the workforce and identify strategies to support women in achieving their career goals. I conclude that childbirth has a significant impact on women's working careers, directly affecting their employment status and income. Through the analysis with Python, I was able to demonstrate the statistical significant relationships between variables with several testing techniques, such as testing the difference in proportions and the t-test for difference in means.
